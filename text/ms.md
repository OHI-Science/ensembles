# Abstract


# Introduction

[@greene2006] probably the closest thing to what we're doing but with climate models (Bayesian multilevel ensemble)

We often have multiple models of ecological systems. For example, models might incorporate different data types, assume alternate population dynamics, or make contrasting assumptions about the starting state of a system. These models may suggest different conclusions about population status and often times we do not know which model is best. How can we reconcile multiple models to make robust management decisions about ecological resources?

When models give conflicting estimates of a population's status, there are a number of solutions. (1) We can pick a single model. However, it isn't always obvious which model is best, and even objectively second-best models may contain useful additional information. (2) We can maintain multiple models throughout the decision-making process. However, this can be complicated (REFs)... (3) We can combine the model outputs. This could be as simple as taking the average, potentially weighting the models by some performance metric. This could be as complicated as forming an additional 'hyper' model that draws on interactions between model outputs and potentially incorporates additional information to derive a best estimate.

Ensemble models are widely used in the climate sciences, where thousands of models are combined across different structural ...
The idea behind ensemble models forms the backbone of many machine learning methods. For example...

In fisheries science, a common problem is estimating the status of an exploited fish population. For the majority of fish stocks, we have limited information to go on and stock status isn't known. In recent years, a number of methods have been proposed to derive population status based on limited information and a set of assumptions. However, we know that these models can give conflicting output and no one model is that accurate.

Here, we develop ensemble models for data-limited exploited fish populations. We explore a variety of ensemble approaches applied to both simulated and real-world fish stocks and compare performance...
