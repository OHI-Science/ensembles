  abstract = {Recently, researchers in several areas of ecology and evolution have begun to change the way in which they analyze data and make biological inferences. Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of accounting for model uncertainty in linear regression models. Conditioning on a single selected model ignores model uncertainty, and thus leads to the underestimation of uncertainty when making inferences about quantities of interest. A Bayesian solution to this problem involves averaging over all possible models (i.e., combinations of predictors) when making inferences about quantities of interest. This approach is often not practical. In this article we offer two alternative approaches. First, we describe an ad hoc procedure, ``Occam's window,'' which indicates a small set of models over which a model average can be computed. Second, we describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach that directly approximates the exact solution. In the presence of model uncertainty, both of these model averaging procedures provide better predictive performance than any single model that might reasonably have been selected. In the extreme case where there are many candidate predictors but no relationship between any of them and the response, standard variable selection procedures often choose some subset of variables that yields a high R 2 and a highly significant overall F value. In this situation, Occam's window usually indicates the null model (or a small number of models including the null model) as the only one (or ones) to be considered thus largely resolving the problem of selecting significant models when there is no signal in the data. Software to implement our methods is available from StatLib.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this review is to clarify the concepts of bias, precision and accuracy as they are commonly defined in the biostatistical literature, with our focus on the use of these concepts in quantitatively testing the performance of point estimators (specifically species richness estimators). We first describe the general concepts underlying bias, precision and accuracy, and then describe a number of commonly used unscaled and scaled performance measures of bias, precision and accuracy (e.g. mean error, variance, standard deviation, mean square error, root mean square error, mean absolute error, and all their scaled counterparts) which may be used to evaluate estimator performance. We also provide mathematical formulas and a worked example for most performance measures. Since every measure of estimator performance should be viewed as suggestive, not prescriptive, we also mention several other performance measures that have been used by biostatisticians or ecologists. We then outline several guidelines of how to test the performance of species richness estimators: the detailed description of data simulation models and resampling schemes, the use of real and simulated data sets on as many different estimators as possible, mathematical expressions for all estimators and performance measures, and the presentation of results for each scaled performance measure in numerical tables with increasing levels of sampling effort. We finish with a literature review of promising new research related to species richness estimation, and summarize the results of 14 studies that compared estimator performance, which confirm that with most data sets, non-parametric estimators (mostly the Chao and jackknife estimators) perform better than other estimators, e.g. curve models or fitting species-abundance distributions.},

This paper outlines the motivation for using multi-model ensembles, reviews the methodologies published so far and compares their results for regional temperature projections. The challenges in interpreting multi-model results, caused by the lack of verification of climate projections, the problem of model dependence, bias and tuning as well as the difficulty in making sense of an `ensemble of opportunity', are discussed in detail.},

Interannual climate variability is an important determinant of epidemics in parts of Africa where climate drives both mosquito vector dynamics and parasite development rates. Hence, skilful seasonal climate forecasts may provide early warning of changes of risk in epidemic-prone regions. Here we discuss the development of a system to forecast probabilities of anomalously high and low malaria incidence with dynamically based, seasonal-timescale, multi-model ensemble predictions of climate, using leading global coupled ocean{\textendash}atmosphere climate models developed in Europe. This forecast system is successfully applied to the prediction of malaria risk in Botswana, where links between malaria and climate variability are well established, adding up to four months lead time over malaria warnings issued with observed precipitation and having a comparably high level of probabilistic prediction skill. In years in which the forecast probability distribution is different from that of climatology, malaria decision-makers can use this information for improved resource allocation.},

  abstract = {Within the European DEMETER project, ensembles of global coupled climate models have shown some skill for seasonal climate prediction. Meteorological outputs of the seasonal prediction system were used in a crop yield model to assess the performance and usefulness of such a system for crop yield forecasting. An innovative method for supplying seasonal forecast information to crop simulation models was developed. It consisted in running a crop model from each individual downscaled member output of climate models. An ensemble of crop yield was obtained and a probability distribution function (PDF) was derived. Preliminary results of wheat yield simulations in Europe using downscaled DEMETER seasonal weather forecasts suggest that reliable crop yield predictions can be obtained using an ensemble multi-model approach. When compared to the operational system, for the same level of accuracy, earlier crop forecasts are obtained with the DEMETER system. Furthermore, PDFs of wheat yield provide information on both the yield anomaly and the uncertainty of the forecast. Based on the spread of the PDF, the user can directly quantify the benefits and risk of taking weather-sensitive decisions. It is shown that the use of ensembles of seasonal weather forecast brings additional information for the crop yield forecasts and therefore has valuable benefit for decision-making in the management of European Union agricultural production.},

In this paper, 17 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project second-phase experiments sharing the same gradual increase in atmospheric CO2 are treated as a probabilistic multimodel ensemble projection of future climate. Tools commonly used for evaluation of probabilistic weather and seasonal forecasts are applied to this climate change ensemble. The probabilities of some temperature- and precipitation-related events defined for 20-yr seasonal means of climate are first studied. A cross-verification exercise is then used to obtain an upper estimate of the quality of these probability forecasts in terms of Brier skill scores, reliability diagrams, and potential economic value. Skill and value estimates are consistently higher for temperature-related events (e.g., will the 20-yr period around the doubling of CO2 be at least 1{\textdegree}C warmer than the present?) than for precipitation-related events (e.g., will the mean precipitation decrease by 10\% or more?). For large enough CO2 forcing, however, probabilistic projections of precipitation-related events also exhibit substantial potential economic value for a range of cost{\textendash}loss ratios. The treatment of climate change information in a probabilistic rather than deterministic manner (e.g., using the ensemble consensus forecast) can greatly enhance its potential value.},

  abstract = {Abstract The ``reliability ensemble averaging'' (REA) method for calculating average, uncertainty range, and a measure of reliability of simulated climate changes at the subcontinental scale from ensembles of different atmosphere{\textendash}ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) simulations is introduced. The method takes into account two ``reliability criteria'': the performance of the model in reproducing present-day climate (``model performance'' criterion) and the convergence of the simulated changes across models (``model convergence'' criterion). The REA method is applied to mean seasonal temperature and precipitation changes for the late decades of the twenty-first century, over 22 land regions of the world, as simulated by a recent set of nine AOGCM experiments for two anthropogenic emission scenarios (the A2 and B2 scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change). In the A2 scenario the REA average regional temperature changes vary between about 2 and 7 K across regions and they are all outside the estimated natural variability. The uncertainty range around the REA average change as measured by \ensuremath{\pm} the REA root-mean-square difference (rmsd) varies between 1 and 4 K across regions and the reliability is mostly between 0.2 and 0.8 (on a scale from 0 to 1). For precipitation, about half of the regional REA average changes, both positive and negative, are outside the estimated natural variability and they vary between about -25\% and +30\% (in units of percent of present-day precipitation). The uncertainty range around these changes (\ensuremath{\pm} rmsd) varies mostly between about 10\% and 30\% and the corresponding reliability varies widely across regions. The simulated changes for the B2 scenario show a high level of coherency with those for the A2 scenario. Compared to simpler approaches, the REA method allows a reduction of the uncertainty range in the simulated changes by minimizing the influence of ``outlier'' or poorly performing models. The method also produces a quantitative measure of reliability that shows that both criteria need to be met by the simulations in order to increase the overall reliability of the simulated changes.},

  abstract = {A Bayesian approach is introduced to model evaluation and multi-model averaging with a systematic consideration of model uncertainty, and its application to global mean surface air temperature (SAT) changes is shown from multi-AOGCM ensembles of IPCC AR4 simulations. The Bayes factor or likelihood ratio of each model to the reference model (where mean is identical to the observation) provides a skill ranging from 0 to 1. Four categories of model skill are derived on the basis of the previous studies. Legendre series expansions are used to get a temporally refined model evaluation, which allow efficient analyses of time mean (scale) and linear trend. Application results show that all AOGCMs with natural plus anthropogenic forcing can simulate well the scale and trend of observed global mean SAT changes over the 20th century and its first and second halves. However, more than 50\% of the models with anthropogenic-only forcing cannot reproduce the observed warming reasonably. This indicates the important role of natural forcing although other factors like different climate sensitivity, forcing uncertainty, and a climate drift might be responsible for the discrepancy in anthropogenic-only models. Besides, Bayesian and conventional skill comparisons demonstrate that a skill-weighted average with the Bayes factors (Bayesian model averaging, BMA) overwhelms the arithmetic ensemble mean and three other weighted averages based on conventional statistics, illuminating future applicability of BMA to climate predictions.},

  abstract = {Regional or local climate change modeling studies currently require starting with a global climate model, then downscaling to the region of interest. How should global models be chosen for such studies, and what effect do such choices have? This question is addressed in the context of a regional climate detection and attribution (D\&A) study of January-February-March (JFM) temperature over the western U.S. Models are often selected for a regional D\&A analysis based on the quality of the simulated regional climate. Accordingly, 42 performance metrics based on seasonal temperature and precipitation, the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation are constructed and applied to 21 global models. However, no strong relationship is found between the score of the models on the metrics and results of the D\&A analysis. Instead, the importance of having ensembles of runs with enough realizations to reduce the effects of natural internal climate variability is emphasized. Also, the superiority of the multimodel ensemble average (MM) to any 1 individual model, already found in global studies examining the mean climate, is true in this regional study that includes measures of variability as well. Evidence is shown that this superiority is largely caused by the cancellation of offsetting errors in the individual global models. Results with both the MM and models picked randomly confirm the original D\&A results of anthropogenically forced JFM temperature changes in the western U.S. Future projections of temperature do not depend on model performance until the 2080s, after which the better performing models show warmer temperatures.},

  abstract = {Abstract Recent coordinated efforts, in which numerous general circulation climate models have been run for a common set of experiments, have produced large datasets of projections of future climate for various scenarios. Those multimodel ensembles sample initial conditions, parameters, and structural uncertainties in the model design, and they have prompted a variety of approaches to quantifying uncertainty in future climate change. International climate change assessments also rely heavily on these models. These assessments often provide equal-weighted averages as best-guess results, assuming that individual model biases will at least partly cancel and that a model average prediction is more likely to be correct than a prediction from a single model based on the result that a multimodel average of present-day climate generally outperforms any individual model. This study outlines the motivation for using multimodel ensembles and discusses various challenges in interpreting them. Among these challenges are that the number of models in these ensembles is usually small, their distribution in the model or parameter space is unclear, and that extreme behavior is often not sampled. Model skill in simulating present-day climate conditions is shown to relate only weakly to the magnitude of predicted change. It is thus unclear by how much the confidence in future projections should increase based on improvements in simulating present-day conditions, a reduction of intermodel spread, or a larger number of models. Averaging model output may further lead to a loss of signal{\textemdash}for example, for precipitation change where the predicted changes are spatially heterogeneous, such that the true expected change is very likely to be larger than suggested by a model average. Last, there is little agreement on metrics to separate ``good'' and ``bad'' models, and there is concern that model development, evaluation, and posterior weighting or ranking are all using the same datasets. While the multimodel average appears to still be useful in some situations, these results show that more quantitative methods to evaluate model performance are critical to maximize the value of climate change projections from global models.},

  abstract = {The skill of the PROVOST (PRediction Of climate Variations On Seasonal to interannual Time-scales) long-range multi-model ensemble integrations is analysed. The ensemble PROVOST forecasts result from integrating three different models over the period 1979{\textendash}93 using analysed sea surface temperatures. For each model, a set of nine-member ensembles have been run from consecutive European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts re-analyses. Using the full set of models, a large multi-model ensemble has been constructed and verified. Positive skill is found for forecasts of geopotential at 500 hPa, temperature at 850 hPa and precipitation. Skilful forecasts tend to occur at the same time in most of the models when skill is computed over large areas; the European region is poorly forecast. The skill commonality may be due to the use of either similar initial conditions or boundary conditions. Skill is shown to be at a maximum in late winter and early spring in mid latitudes. No means have been found for linearly predicting the skill of the ensemble mean using the ensemble spread. The multi-model ensemble improves the skill of the individual models only marginally when verifying the ensemble mean. However, when using the full ensemble in a probabilistic formulation, the multi-model approach offers a systematic improvement. The improvement arises both from the use of different models in the ensemble and from the higher ensemble size obtained by combining all of the models for building the multi-model ensemble. It is shown that a part of the skill improvement in the tropics is due to the multi-model approach, mainly in spring and summer. On the other hand, most of the gain in the extratropics comes from the increase in ensemble size.},

  abstract = {Abstract Ensembles used for probabilistic weather forecasting often exhibit a spread-error correlation, but they tend to be underdispersive. This paper proposes a statistical method for postprocessing ensembles based on Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which is a standard method for combining predictive distributions from different sources. The BMA predictive probability density function (PDF) of any quantity of interest is a weighted average of PDFs centered on the individual bias-corrected forecasts, where the weights are equal to posterior probabilities of the models generating the forecasts and reflect the models' relative contributions to predictive skill over the training period. The BMA weights can be used to assess the usefulness of ensemble members, and this can be used as a basis for selecting ensemble members; this can be useful given the cost of running large ensembles. The BMA PDF can be represented as an unweighted ensemble of any desired size, by simulating from the BMA predictive distribution. The BMA predictive variance can be decomposed into two components, one corresponding to the between-forecast variability, and the second to the within-forecast variability. Predictive PDFs or intervals based solely on the ensemble spread incorporate the first component but not the second. Thus BMA provides a theoretical explanation of the tendency of ensembles to exhibit a spread-error correlation but yet be underdispersive. The method was applied to 48-h forecasts of surface temperature in the Pacific Northwest in January{\textendash}June 2000 using the University of Washington fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University{\textendash}NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) ensemble. The predictive PDFs were much better calibrated than the raw ensemble, and the BMA forecasts were sharp in that 90\% BMA prediction intervals were 66\% shorter on average than those produced by sample climatology. As a by-product, BMA yields a deterministic point forecast, and this had root-mean-square errors 7\% lower than the best of the ensemble members and 8\% lower than the ensemble mean. Similar results were obtained for forecasts of sea level pressure. Simulation experiments show that BMA performs reasonably well when the underlying ensemble is calibrated, or even overdispersed.},

Here we report a systematic attempt to determine the range of climate changes consistent with these uncertainties, based on a 53-member ensemble of model versions constructed by varying model parameters. We estimate a probability density function for the sensitivity of climate to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and obtain a 5{\textendash}95 per cent probability range of 2.4{\textendash}5.4 {\textdegree}C. Our probability density function is constrained by objective estimates of the relative reliability of different model versions, the choice of model parameters that are varied and their uncertainty ranges, specified on the basis of expert advice. Our ensemble produces a range of regional changes much wider than indicated by traditional methods based on scaling the response patterns of an individual simulation.},

Various statistical methods have been proposed to improve ensemble predictions from deterministic computer simulations based on actual measurements of the physical systems (e.g. data assimilation, Bayesian model averaging). Ensemble data mining methods have also been developed for a wide variety of applications to combine different versions of a statistical model (e.g. time series models, simple regression models, neural networks) to improve the predictive model performance.

  abstract = {Abstract Multimodel combination is a pragmatic approach to estimating model uncertainties and to making climate projections more reliable. The simplest way of constructing a multimodel is to give one vote to each model (``equal weighting''), while more sophisticated approaches suggest applying model weights according to some measure of performance (``optimum weighting''). In this study, a simple conceptual model of climate change projections is introduced and applied to discuss the effects of model weighting in more generic terms. The results confirm that equally weighted multimodels on average outperform the single models, and that projection errors can in principle be further reduced by optimum weighting. However, this not only requires accurate knowledge of the single model skill, but the relative contributions of the joint model error and unpredictable noise also need to be known to avoid biased weights. If weights are applied that do not appropriately represent the true underlying uncertainties, weighted multimodels perform on average worse than equally weighted ones, which is a scenario that is not unlikely, given that at present there is no consensus on how skill-based weights can be obtained. Particularly when internal variability is large, more information may be lost by inappropriate weighting than could potentially be gained by optimum weighting. These results indicate that for many applications equal weighting may be the safer and more transparent way to combine models. However, also within the presented framework eliminating models from an ensemble can be justified if they are known to lack key mechanisms that are indispensable for meaningful climate projections.},
